/*
 * Key Differences Between `assert` and `expect`:
 *
 * | Feature                | assert (JavaScript)                         | expect (Playwright)                                  |
 * |------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
 * | Use Case               | General programming conditions              | Browser or web element-related conditions            |
 * | Scope                  | Any condition in JavaScript                 | Web page or browser-specific conditions              |
 * | Retries/Timeouts       | No retry, fails immediately if False        | Automatically retries until timeout (default 30s)    |
 * | Asynchronous Support   | Not built-in (use libraries for async)      | Yes, designed for async UI changes                   |
 * | Custom Error Messages  | Can be defined in console.assert            | Built-in detailed error messages                     |
 * | Example Use            | console.assert(value === expected)          | expect(page.locator("button")).toBeVisible()        |
 * | Error Handling         | Logs to console without stopping execution  | Waits for conditions to be met or timeouts           |
 *
 * When to Use:
 * Use console.assert: When you want to check simple, immediate conditions that donâ€™t depend on the state of a web page or browser.
 * It's ideal for checking values, types, or performing simple condition checks in your JavaScript code.
 *
 * Use expect: When you need to assert conditions related to web elements, such as visibility, text content, or attributes.
 * It is specifically built for web automation and includes retry mechanisms, timeouts, and handling of dynamic content changes in modern web applications.

/*
 * Interview Questions and Answers:
 * 
 * Q1: What is the purpose of the expect API in Playwright?
 * A1: The expect API is used for making assertions about the state of web elements. It includes built-in waiting and retry mechanisms, making it suitable for testing dynamic web applications.
 * 
 * Q2: How does expect differ from assert?
 * A2: expect is asynchronous and designed for web testing, allowing for retries and automatic waiting for conditions. assert (or console.assert in JavaScript) is synchronous and used for immediate condition checks.
 * 
 * 
 * Q3: How can we ensure that an element is visible before interacting with it?
 * A4: By using the expect API, such as expect(locator).toBeVisible(), Playwright automatically waits until the element is visible before performing actions.
